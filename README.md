### ⚠️ Heads Up!
<p>This project will no longer be maintained when FBLA-PBL 2020-2021 ends. If you want to use this repo for personal use, everything should be stable and working for PHP 7.0+ . I would not recommend cloning this repo for an event, it could lead to getting disqualified.</p>

### Why PHP?
<p>Most people may question why I built this application using PHP, rather than C++ or Python. This is because the application can be easily deployed on a web server. Then, a user can easily access it through a URL. Also, many hosting services support PHP.

I built this application using the MVC method, along with a somewhat OOP coding style. The code should look neat and tidy, as well as easy to read.
